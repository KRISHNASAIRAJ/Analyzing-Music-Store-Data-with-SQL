## Dataset - Music Store Data
The dataset used in this project is the Music Store Data, consisting of multiple CSV files. It includes information on employees, invoices, customers, music genres, tracks, albums, and artists.

#### The SQL queries within this repository perform various analyses and provide insights based on this dataset.

## Data Preprocessing Guide
To import the CSV files into your SQL database and preprocess the data, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Database
Start by creating a new database where you'll import the Music Store dataset.

### 2. Using SQL Sidebar Explorer
Open the SQL Sidebar Explorer in your SQL tool of choice and select the newly created database.

### 3. Import CSV Files
Right-click on the tables within the database.
Choose the option 'Table Data Import Wizard'.
Select the respective CSV file from your file explorer.
Verify and adjust data types as necessary.
Proceed with the import process.

### 4. Verify Data Import
Ensure that the data has been successfully imported into your database as tables.

Now, your CSV files are processed and integrated as tables within your SQL database, ready for analysis using the provided SQL queries.

This guide outlines the steps to import the CSV files into your SQL database via the SQL Sidebar Explorer, ensuring a smooth preprocessing of the Music Store dataset for subsequent analysis using the SQL queries provided in this repository.

## Future Scope
The future scope of this project involves building a frontend interface to interact with the database. This frontend can offer visualizations, user interactions, and a more intuitive way to explore and analyze the Music Store Data.
